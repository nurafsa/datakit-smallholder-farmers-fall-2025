# Beatrice Liu: Challenge 4 - Crop Questions Analysis 

## Overview
Conducted word frequency analysis on uestions by Kenyan Farmers in the Producers Direct Dataset of WeFarm SMS; created interactive and static visualizations of top bi-, tri-, and quad-grams on top 5 topics -  cattle, tomato, maize, chickens, none -  to identify patterns and relationships and communicate insights concisely. Note:  I can't figure out how to display the interactive graphs here, but they are saved in the network_graphs folder.

See 'farmers.bliu.pdf' for summary of findings

## Research Questions
- What insights can be gleaned from Crop-specific and Crop-Independent Questions?  


## Methodology: *detailed explanations in the Jupyter Notebooks*

### Data Sources
- Producers Direct Dataset of WeFarm SMS
- Swahili [stopword](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mmf4hnsm2n/1) and [verb conjugation](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rvt89578g5/1) files  

### Approach: *Notebook overviews describe steps in greater detail - see 'Q4.Ngrams.Jupyter.Notebooks.pdf' for list of notebooks and their running order*
1. **Data loading and initial exploration**
2. **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
3. **Data segmentation into smaller datasets for analyses: unique questions asked by farmers in 4 countries**
4. **Filtered dataset for questions by Kenyan farmers**
5. **NLP - remove punctuation marks, lowercas, tokenize using custom list of stopwords and lemma dictionaries**
6. **Count word occurance in list of words created in Step 5**
7. **Generate list of tuples for more frequent words for visualization and interpretation**


### Output Files and Visualizations
- Cleaned data files and interactive visualizations can be found in [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tpwqTqoFfZCWvDvncJjaSbzzua0Y6Q_i?usp=sharing)
- Note:  visualizations are uploaded to github in 'network_graphs' folder
- N-gram frequency graphs can be found in individual notebooks *(the PNG files cropped out the n-gram text)*


### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.13.5 
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, deep-language... - full list is in the notebooks
- **GenAI Tools Used**: ChatGPT, Anaconda Toolbox
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook


### Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: Used for generating code for natural language processing functions in English, translating Swahili tokens into English
- **Anaconda Toolbox**: Used for generating interactive network graphs

### Human Review Process
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and tested for accuracy
- Modified AI suggestions in the following ways: fix a surprising number of coding errors


## Key Findings: *Refer to 'farmers.bliu.pdf'*


### Finding: Translating from Swahili is a **major** roadblock
- Created bi- and tri-grams in Swahili to reduce # of characters that needed to be translated
- Tri-grams from Swahili questions are similar to English ones...
- but need *better* lemmatization, normalizing tools, Swahili corpus, and translator.  


### Additional Findings:  *Refer to 'farmers.bliu.pdf'*

## Visualizations: *see file list below* 


## Limitations and Challenges

### Data Limitations
- Missing data issues:  gender, location other than country
- Data quality concerns: vague data dictionary
- Translations:  These African languages are linguistically complex, with unique syntax, idioms, and dialectal variations that are region-specific.  

### Methodological Limitations
- Assumptions made: 'blocked' and 'destroyed' user statuses were dropped from analysis.
- Impractical to call on GoogleTranslate to translate the full text of > 2 mm questions:  extracted and translated most frequent combination of words in the questions
  

### Technical Challenges
- Translation accuracy issues - YES! Swahili is an under-resourced language in Natural Language Processing and commonly used Python packages such as SpaCy, NLTK, or Gensim do not have inherent Swahili support
